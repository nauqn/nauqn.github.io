<!-- USING CLASS SELECTOR -->
        <p>Leadership and teamwork is very important to me. Without a team, ideas wouldn't be created and approached. It is of utmost importance to have a graceful flow of communication and effort in the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>I am very detailed oriented. Creating many engineering drawings and files demonstrate this skill. I have used CAD designs such as Autodesk Inventor, and Creo in a professional environment. Wrote technical reports for process documentation.
          </p>
      <p>I am very hands-on oriented compared to most Mechanical Engineers based on my previous experiences.
